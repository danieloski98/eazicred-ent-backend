## 📊 Analytics Data

The admin analytics endpoint provides:
- Total loans count
- Pending loans count
- Approved loans count
- Funded loans count
- Repaid loans count
- Rejected loans count
- Total loan amount
- Total funded amount
- Total repaid amount

## 🔄 Loan Application Flow

1. **Employee** applies for a loan → Status: PENDING
2. **HR** reviews and approves → Status: APPROVED, hrApproved: true
3. **Loan Company** views approved loans
4. **Loan Company** funds the loan → Status: FUNDED, loanCompanyApproved: true
5. **Loan Company** marks as repaid → Status: REPAID

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT signing
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` - Token expiration time (default: 24h)

## 🧪 Testing

- Application builds successfully without errors
- All TypeScript type checks pass
- MongoDB integration working
- Swagger documentation accessible
- All endpoints functional
- Role-based access control working
- JWT authentication working

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **HR Token Refresh**: After creating a company, HR users should login again to get a new token with the companyId included.

2. **Password Requirements**: All passwords must be at least 6 characters long.

3. **Token Expiration**: JWT tokens expire after 24 hours by default.

4. **Database**: MongoDB must be running before starting the application.

5. **Swagger UI**: Available at `http://localhost:3000/api` for interactive API testing.

- Implement loan repayment schedules
- Add file upload for loan documents
- Implement loan amount limits based on employee salary
- Add audit logging for all operations
- Implement refresh tokens
